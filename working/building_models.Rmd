Graph of US quarterly data (not annualized) from 1947 through 2002 estimates a form of the difference version of

Okunâ€™s law:

%Change GNP = 0.856 - 1.827(Change Unemployment Rate)

R^2 of .504.

Differences from other results are partly due to the use of quarterly data http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okun%27s_law

Write the function in R!
```{r}
percent_change_gdp = function(unemployment_rate, m = -1.827, b = 0.856) {
  #Okun's law
  deltaGDP = (m * unemployment_rate) + b
  return(deltaGDP)
}
```

Q: What is change in GDP for unemployment rate change of 3%?
```{r}
percent_change_gdp(3)
```

Q: What would the change in GDP be for 3% change in unemployment rate if the slope was 10% higher?
```{r}
percent_change_gdp(m = (-1.827*0.1), 3)
```
